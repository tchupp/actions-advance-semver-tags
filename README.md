# GitHub Actions: update-semver-tags

GitHub Action for updating semver tags when a release is published.

[SemVer (or Semantic Versioning)](https://semver.org/) is a strategy for versioning with a Major, Minor, and Patch version.

Let's say your latest release is version `v1.2.3`.
It's often convenient to have tags for `v1.2` and `v1` for loose version pinning.

This GitHub Action will update the `v1.2` and `v1` tags when a new release is published.
